Bangaluru House Price Prediction Using ML

MARCH 14, 2023

Introduction

In this tutorial, we will implement a Bangalore House Price Prediction model using a Machine Learning algorithm. This model predicts the price of Bangalore's house with the help of a few parameters like availability, size, total square feet, bath, location, etc. 



During this Bangaluru House Price prediction using Machine Learning tutorial you will learn several things like :-

1.Exploratory data analysis
2.Dealing with a missing values or noisy data
3.Data preprocessing
4.Create new features from existing features
5.Remove outliers
6.Splitting data into the training and testing 
7.Train linear regression model and test
8.Deploy project using flak for gui aplication
